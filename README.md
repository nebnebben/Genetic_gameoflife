# Genetic_gameoflife

This uses a genetic algorithm to find the most dense structures in a Conway's Game of Life simulation after a certain number of iterations.
There are a few bugs to iron out, and the visuals and UI are very lacking but in terms of functionality it all works. It is also documented so you can see how it all works.
